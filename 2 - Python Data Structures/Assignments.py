#Convert the extracted value to a floating point number and print it out.

WRITING PROGRAMS OR PROGRAMMING IS A VERY CREATIVE
AND REWARDING ACTIVITY  YOU CAN WRITE PROGRAMS FOR
MANY REASONS RANGING FROM MAKING YOUR LIVING TO SOLVING
A DIFFICULT DATA ANALYSIS PROBLEM TO HAVING FUN TO HELPING
SOMEONE ELSE SOLVE A PROBLEM  THIS BOOK ASSUMES THAT
{\EM EVERYONE} NEEDS TO KNOW HOW TO PROGRAM AND THAT ONCE
YOU KNOW HOW TO PROGRAM, YOU WILL FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU WANT
TO DO WITH YOUR NEWFOUND SKILLS

WE ARE SURROUNDED IN OUR DAILY LIVES WITH COMPUTERS RANGING
FROM LAPTOPS TO CELL PHONES  WE CAN THINK OF THESE COMPUTERS
AS OUR PERSONAL ASSISTANTS WHO CAN TAKE CARE OF MANY THINGS
ON OUR BEHALF  THE HARDWARE IN OUR CURRENT-DAY COMPUTERS
IS ESSENTIALLY BUILT TO CONTINUOUSLY AS US THE QUESTION
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO DO NEXT

OUR COMPUTERS ARE FAST AND HAVE VASTS AMOUNTS OF MEMORY AND
COULD BE VERY HELPFUL TO US IF WE ONLY KNEW THE LANGUAGE TO
SPEAK TO EXPLAIN TO THE COMPUTER WHAT WE WOULD LIKE IT TO
DO NEXT IF WE KNEW THIS LANGUAGE WE COULD TELL THE
COMPUTER TO DO TASKS ON OUR BEHALF THAT WERE REPTITIVE
INTERESTINGLY, THE KINDS OF THINGS COMPUTERS CAN DO BEST
ARE OFTEN THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE HUMANS FIND BORING
AND MIND-NUMBING

#7.2
#Write a program that prompts for a file name, then opens that file and reads through the file, looking for lines of the form:
#X-DSPAM-Confidence:    0.8475
#Count these lines and extract the floating point values from each of the lines and compute the average of those values and produce an output as shown below. 
#Do not use the sum() function or a variable named sum in your solution.
#You can download the sample data at http://www.py4e.com/code3/mbox-short.txt when you are testing below enter mbox-short.txt as the file name.

# Use the file name mbox-short.txt as the file name

#Open the file romeo.txt and read it line by line. For each line, split the line into a list of words using the split() method.
#The program should build a list of words. For each word on each line check to see if the word is already in the list and if not append it to the list. 
#When the program completes, sort and print the resulting words in python sort() order as shown in the desired output.

#After the dictionary is produced, the program reads through the dictionary using a maximum loop to find the most prolific committer.
